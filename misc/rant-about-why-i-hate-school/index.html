            <h1>A rant about why I hate school:</h1>
            <br>
            <p>&emsp;Why would you sacrifice your free time, your sleep, your time to work on personal projects, and your time with your friends for an overly difficult, slow, and stressful way of learning something you could learn much faster an easier if you take an online course at your own pace?
                <br>&emsp;I honestly don't really get today's education system and why people bother with it.
                <br>&emsp;School today pressures students with hours of homework and cause students to be sleep deprived, which can cause lots of stress and hinders their ability to learn things.
                <br>&emsp;Students are forced to learn things that they'll never use in life. Like, when was the last time you had to know the anatomy of a bacteriophage or know how to solve a differential equation for your everyday lives or careers? (unless you work in those fields) I'm not sure if this is the case for college, as students have more control over what they are learning there, but in middle-high school this is definitely the case.)
                <br>&emsp;In addition, we don't even have the time to work on personal projects or learn about the things we WILL use in life. It's as if school is designed to hinder success rather than create it.
                <br>&emsp;Teachers use the absolute worst methods of teaching. Things like lecturing are horrible for students. The students aren't interacting with anything, they don't remember everything that the teacher says, unless you are always taking notes, which is hard for many students. Even then, what they are learning isn't very cemented in their brains, because they aren't interacting with anything, they aren't doing anything.
                <br>&emsp;In these systems, you don't even get the experience needed to work in a company, because you aren't working with other people, you aren't learning how to collaborate with other people effectively. School isn't teaching what is necessary for modern life, just what is pointless and what students don't need.
                <br>&emsp;It's a very slow and painful process as well. Anything that you could learn in school, you could learn it many times faster and better if you teach it yourself with online courses and projects and other ways of self-driven learning.
                <br>&emsp;Anything other than your own pace is going to be extremely slow, because if it's too fast, you'll be stuck behind and have to work overtime to catch up, and if its too slow, well, it's going to be slower than potential.</p>
